You can save a series of actions that are repeatedly used in test scenarios as an action block and add them all at once.

## 1. Creating Action Blocks

Select the range of actions you want to group into an action block by pressing the `Shift` key.

Right-click on the action range and click **\[Create Action Block\]** to create an action block.

Set a name for the action block.

<Note>
  After modifying the name of the action block or the actions within it, <br />
  click the **\[Update\]** button to apply the changes to other tests.
</Note>

## 2. Using Action Blocks

You can add an action block by clicking the **\[+\] button > \[Add Action Block\]** button at the top right of the **\[Test Steps\]** panel in the Reliv Editor.

## 3. Action Block Parameters

You can define parameters to manage values that need to change depending on usage context.

This is similar to using [variables](/guide/write/variable) within an action block,

but by using parameters, you can receive variable values from outside the action block and use them.

### 3-1. Creating Action Block Parameters

You can add a parameter by clicking the **\[+ Add Parameter\]** button at the top of the action block.

The `Key` of the parameter corresponds to the name of the variable, and the `Value` corresponds to the value of the variable.

The method for setting the value of a parameter is the same as [creating a variable](/guide/write/variable#1).

<Note>
  You can use variables from the parent level of the action block in the
  parameter values.

### 3-2. Using Action Block Parameters

When you type `{` (curly braces) in a text input field, a list of parameters/variables/environment variables/functions will appear.

You can click to insert a parameter.
