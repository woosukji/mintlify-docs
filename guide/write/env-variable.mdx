You can designate frequently used text as environment variables and use them by calling them into your tests.

Unlike [Variables](/guide/write/variable), environment variables are shared across the entire project.

They are suitable for values (such as URLs, account IDs, etc.) that need to vary according to the test execution environment (local/dev/prod, etc.).

## 1. Setting Environment Variables

In the text input field, drag to select the part you wish to set as an environment variable.

Click the **\[Set as Variable\]** button, and you can set it as an environment variable through the setting popup.

<Note>
  Environment variable names can only use uppercase and lowercase letters,
  numbers, underscores (\_), and dashes (-).
</Note>

## 2. Using Environment Variables

When you type `{` (curly braces) in a text input field, a list of environment variables will appear.

You can click to insert an environment variable.

<Note>You can search by typing part of the environment variable name.</Note>

## 3. Editing Environment Variables

Select the **\[Settings\]** tab at the top of the project screen to go to the project settings page.

In the **\[Environment Variables\]** tab, you can manage your environment variables.

<Note>
  By clicking the **\[Add new environment\]** button, you can add a new
  environment. <br />
  Set environment variables to match different execution environments (such as local,
  dev, prod, etc.).
