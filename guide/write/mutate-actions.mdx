## 1. Selecting Multiple Actions (Multi Select)

By clicking on two actions while holding down the `Shift` key, all actions between them will be selected.

## 2. Changing the Order of Actions (Drag & Drop)

You can change the order of actions by dragging them while holding down the **\[handle button\]** that appears to the right of an action when you hover over it.

If multiple actions are selected, you can move them all at once by dragging the handle button.
