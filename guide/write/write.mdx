While in record mode, performing the test in the browser will record each step in the editor.

When the test recording is complete, exit record mode by clicking the **\[Stop Recording\]** button at the bottom of the editor.

  You can save the test you've written by clicking the **\[ ðŸ’¾ \]** button at
  the top right of the Reliv Editor.

## 3. Playing the Test

After exiting record mode, click the **\[Play All\]** button at the bottom of the editor to play the test from beginning to end.

  allowing you to **partially play the test from the current breakpoint to that action**.
