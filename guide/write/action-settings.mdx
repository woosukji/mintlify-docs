The detailed options are as follows.

| Option         | Default  | Description                                                                                        |
| -------------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Optional Run` | False    | If checked, **the playback continues even if this step fails**.                                    |
| `Timeout`      | 3000(ms) | **The maximum waiting time for the element to appear on the screen**.                              |
