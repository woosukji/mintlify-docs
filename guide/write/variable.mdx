You can designate and use repeatedly used values as variables within your tests.

Unlike [Environment Variables](/guide/write/env-variable), these are temporary variables that are retained only during the execution of the test.

## 1. Creating Variables

You can add a variable by clicking the **\[+\]** button at the top right of the **\[Test Steps\]** panel in the Reliv Editor and then clicking **\[Add Variable\]**.

You can enter the desired variable value as text, or use various types of variables by typing `{` (curly braces).

- **Variable**: Enter the name of a variable defined before the current step.
- **Environment Variable**: These are predefined variables that apply to the entire project.
- **Function**: You can use it to generate a string following a specific rule.

The functions currently supported are as follows.
| Function | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `random()` | Generates a random alphanumeric string. <br /> By default, it generates a string of length 10. <br /> You can specify the length of the string to be generated, like `random(1)`. |
| `now()` | Generates the current time string at the time of execution. <br /> By default, it generates the current time string in ISO 8601 format. <br /> You can specify the format by entering a [day.js format](https://day.js.org/docs/en/parse/string-format), like `now('YYYY-MM-DD')`. |

## 2. Using Variables

When you type `{` (curly braces) in a text input field, a list of variables/environment variables/functions will appear.

You can click to insert a variable.

<Note>
  Each action block has its own namespace for variables. <br />
  Variables defined in one action block (or the top-level) are not recognized inside
  another action block. <br />
  If you want to use a variable from outside an action block inside it, use
  [action block parameters](/guide/action-block#3).
